<p><b>Procedure</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Simulator will display required chemical such as CuSO4, conc.H2SO4, K4[Fe(CN)6], NH4NO3, spectrocolorimrter,test tube, conical flask, dropper.<br>
 Click on the green arrow button which is provided at the right corner of the simulator to proceed further.<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Click on the beaker to add and pour CuSO4.<br>
  Then click on the beaker  of water to add it and then click on conc.H2SO4.<br>
  Click on the arrow to proceed for next step.<br>
  <b>Step 3:</b>Take 2.5 ml of solution through dropper and pour it into test tube then add K4[Fe(CN)6] by add and pour method.<br>
 Add NH4NO3 by clicking on the bottle.<br>
  Now, required solution is prepared and ready to measure its optical density.<br>
  Click on the arrow to proceed for next step.<br>
  <b>Step 4:</b>Turn on the spectrocolimeter by clocking on the <b>"power on"</b> button.<br> 
  Place the test tube in spectrocolorimeter by drad and drop method.<br>
  Set the wavelength by clicking on <b>"set wavelength"</b> button.<br>
  Note the reading which is displayed by the spectrocolorimeter.<br>
  <b>Step 5:</b> A pop up will appear which contain a question fill the correct answer to proceed further.<br>
  Again perform this experiment for 5.0,7.5 and 10 ml of solution and  note the reading.
  After, taking fourth reading click on the arrow for next step.<br>
  <b>Step 6:</b>Observation table will displayed, fill the optical densities which we will get by the spectrocolorimeter then click on fill table to get the mean optical density.<br>
  <b>Step 7:</b>Click on <b>"Plot graph"</b> to get the calibrated graph.<br>
 <b>Step 8:</b> Note the reading corresponding to the mean optical density to calculate the amount of copper present in the taken solution.<br></p>
