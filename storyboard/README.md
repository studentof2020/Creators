Round 2:
**1. Story outline**

This experiment is about determining copper concentration in a given water. It involves preparing solution by adding 0.2 g of CuSO4 into a 100 ml SMF and made upto the mark using distilled water. A drop of concentrated H2SO4 is added to prevent precipitation of Cu(OH)2. This solution is approximately diluted to 10 times in a 100 ml SMF. 2.5 ml of this solution is taken in a test tube. 5 ml of 10% NH4NO3 and 1 ml of 4% K4[Fe(CN)6] are added and made up to 15 ml. The optical density of this solution is measured using a spectrocolorimeter after fixing maximum wavelength at 480 nm. Similar measurements are made with 5.0, 7.5 and 10 ml of standard CuSO4 solution and the calibration line is obtained. From the calibration line, the amount of copper (II) present in the unknown is determined using its optical density.
