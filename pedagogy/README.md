<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Students will be able to identify the apparatus and reagents  being used in the experiment. | Student has to select the  required apperatus and  reagents from the list display by the simulator. | What is the weight of CuSO4 has been taken to prepare the solution ?<br> A.0.4g<br>B. 0.5g<br><b>C. 0.2g</b><br>D. 0.45g 
2.| Students will be able to describe  the "preparation of sample" for the experiment. | Student has to prepare the sample using reagents. | Why concentrated H2S04 added? A. It behave as much better conductor <br> B. To prevent precipitation of Cu(OH)2 <br> C. To get the right experimental value <br> D. None of these 
3.| Students will be able to Apply the experimental conditions by placing sample and setting maximum wavelength in spectro calorimeter. | Student has to place the sample and set the maximum wavelength in spectrocolorimeter. | What  is the maximum wavelenght at which experiment is being performed? <br> A 48 nm <br> B 480 mm <br> C 480 nm <br> D. none of the above.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student has to select the  required apperatus and  reagents which is display by the simulator| Simulator will display apperatus, reagents  and give instruction " select the apperatus and reagents required for the experiment".| To make user remember the requisites of the experimetent.
2.| Student will be able to describe  the "preparation of sample" for the experiment | Simulator will display selected apperatus and reagents and display instruction to mix reagents for sample sample preperation| To make student used to with the sample preperation.
3.| Student has to set maximum wavelenght at which experiment is being performed and place the sample in spectrocolorimeter |Simulator will popup instruction to set wavelength and place sample in spectrocolorimeter| To make student well known with the maximum wavelength on which experiment is performed.
4.| Student will use the spectrocolorimeter and record the reading. | Simulator will allow the student to record the reading| To make the student accustemed in recording the reading.
5.| Student has to press the "plot graph" button and give the answer of the question | Simulator will display "plot graph" button and  popup the question "is the plotted graph is straight line?" (Yes/No).| To check whether the plotted graph is correct .
6.| Student has to press on "show result" button and answer the question |Simulator will display "show result" button and popup the question "Choose the correct formula? <br> A. x(calculated from graph) X wt. of Cu/wt. of CuSO4 <br> B. x(calculated from graph) X wt. of Cu/wt. of CuSO4.5H2O? <br>| To make the Students well known with the formula used in calculation of concentration </b> <br>.
